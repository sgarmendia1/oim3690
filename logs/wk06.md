## What I learned this week
    - learned about <div> and <span> and when to use each: <div> as a block container <span> as inline container for small parts of text.
    - learned pseudo-classes like :hover, :focus, :first-child
    - learned CSS variables (--name) to manage repeated values like colors and spacing
## Code I'm proud of
## Challenges I faced
    - still confusing when to use inline vs block vs inline-block 
    - hard to understand all pseudo-classes
## AI usage
    - used ai to help with questions about pseudo classes
    - used ai to help me start my personal project
